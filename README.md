# TypeScript Shopping List!

Welcome to the best new To Do List app on the web!

![user view](./public/userView.png)

## Technology Used

This app was created with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Typescript was chosen to prevent datatype errors from popping up in the runtime environment during development. The app was bundled with Snowpack. Snowpack is a fast, lightweight bundler that allows for module integration due to its ESM foundation. Snowpack bundles up node modules for use by the browser, and also provides live re-rendering so that development changes are reflected instantly in the browser.



## Installation

You will need the proper node packages installed to contribute to this project. Use the CLI to install the proper node packages in the directory where you have cloned the repository. The necessary dev dependencies can always be found in the package.json. The following CLI command will install dev dependencies listed in the package.json

```bash
npm install
```

To start the react app in your browser run
```npm start```

## Usage
Simply add needed items by typing the name of the item in the form. Click the 'Add To List' button to add the item to the list. If items need to be cleared from the list, simply check the box next to the item and then click the 'Clear Checked Items' button.
